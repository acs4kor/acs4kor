## Hi there 👋

### I am Avil Mascarenhas,
### As a System Administrator and IT consultant I focus on combining both skill sets to deliver solutions. Over the past 8 years I have gained extensive experience in contact center solutions .
### Currently I am a Zendesk administrator at GRAB, maintaining the ticketing system for the entire SEA region. I actively participate in analysis, design and solutioning of the integrations of tickets through various channels to the Zendesk which will be handled by the CE agents regionally.
### Prior to this, I was Technical consultant at Tetherfi, delivering the Tetherfi's contact center solutions, and also designing and developing minor components in their product suite.
